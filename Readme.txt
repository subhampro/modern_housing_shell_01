Thank you for useing this Shell from SubhamPRO Store !

1. We Provide Furnished and UnFurnished Version Of the Shell at Same cost. You are free to use any version you want.

Points to be taken care of:-

1. Do not rename any file (ydr,ycd,ytyp,ytd) otherwise shell won't work.

2. If you face light flickering issue and there is water when you are in shell then simply delete the house
from there and add it into another place.

3. To make the shell work you have to list their ytyp in fxmanifest.lua that you will get in this folder.

Everything is properly tested ;)

---------------------------

If you want to Run Both Furnished and Unfurnished you need to copy the .fxap file and put it inside Solo Shell Folder and Run them as a separate Resource. [ If Its Free resource then Just Cut the Solo Shell Folder and Run as Independent Script It will Run Smoothly ]
